# Projects

---

You will engage in four projects (P_XX) throughout the semester, building prototypes of objects, interfaces, and spaces that interrogate each human sense and their role in shaping our environment. A final and cumulative design project (P_FINAL) will synthesize your research interests into a larger scale object or experience. Short assignments (A_XX) will preface each project with precedent research.

Although each project will likely take on various forms, you will still need to clearly communicate your project through at least a PDF submission. Supplemental submissions -- such as videos, websites, or other prototypes -- are strongly encouraged to tell your project story convincingly.
