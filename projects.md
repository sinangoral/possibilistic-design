# Projects

Through four projects (P_XX), you will build prototypes of objects, spaces, or interactions that interrogate each human sense and its role in shaping our environment. A final, cumulative design project (P_FINAL) will synthesize your research interests into a larger scale object or experiential installation. Short assignments (A_XX) will preface each project with precedent research.
