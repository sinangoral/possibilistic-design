# Projects

---

Through four projects (P_XX), you will build prototypes of objects, spaces, or interactions that interrogate each human sense and its role in shaping our environment. A final, cumulative design project (P_FINAL) will synthesize your research interests into a larger scale object or experiential installation. Short assignments (A_XX) will preface each project with precedent research.

Although each project will likely take on various forms, you will still need to clearly communicate your project through at least a PDF submission. Supplmenetal materials -- such as videos, websites, or other prototypes -- are strongly encouraged. Be thoughtful in how you curate your work.
