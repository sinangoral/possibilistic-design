# Projects

---

Through four projects (P_XX), you will build prototypes of objects, spaces, or interactions that interrogate each human sense and its role in shaping our environment. A final, cumulative design project (P_FINAL) will synthesize your research interests into a larger scale object or experiential installation. Short assignments (A_XX) will preface each project with precedent research.

| P_01 <br> 2.0 weeks      | Sight might very well be our most valued sense. It is the primary gateway through which we measure, chart, and comprehend our spaces and objects. It also keeps us safe, quite literally providing the eyes and window to the soul. <br> But sight is also overrated. It is the go-to sense for designers and architects, oftentimes distracting away from the untapped potential of other forms of perception. As Juhani Pallasmaa argues in The Eyes of the Skin, the dominance of visual imagery and stimulation in architecture and design thinking suppresses the advents of other senses. Appearances take center stage, limiting the effect, reach, and poetics of other forms of cognitive mapping. Compounded by the hyper-visual nature of the digital world, the dominance of the visual seems to be more pressing than ever. <br> Our phenomenological understanding of everyday life surely relies on more than just sight as a form of sensorial intake. Perhaps our attitude towards sight is too constrained, inhibiting us from unearthing alternative interpretations of seeing and environing altogether. Whatever the case may be, the dominance of sight in the shaping of our worldview suggests an interesting opportunity for reflection and intervention. <br> What are alternative possibilities granted by seeing? And how might we reframe sight so that it complements other senses in lieu of drowning them out?
